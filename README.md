# FindDuplicateFiles

The software should find duplicate files in a harddisk and write a text (ASCII) files where each line lists all occurrences of a given duplicated file, all separated by a ; character. For example:

  c:\win\file1.bin; c:\data\file1.bin; c:\file1.bin
  c:\f.txt; c:\mine\f.txt

Note that a duplicate file is defined as having the same name and also the contents (therefore, the same size).
